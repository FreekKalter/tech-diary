Diary/log of decisions i made and the arguments for them, mostly for future reference.

Every file represents its own category. For now I have only written down some thoughts about licenses. 
This is a good example because its the sort of thing I want to research once and then forget about it. 
Now i just have to remember to use gpl v3. 
And I can forget about the arguments for choosing that particular license. Because i think it is important, 
but not all that interesting. Things i dont find interesting are very easily forgotten. Now I always 
have something to refer back to, when i cant remember what led me to choose gpv v3 as my main license of choice.
