# Licenses

## 14-02-15

I am a strong believer in opensource software. So I wnat to make sure that some of the code I write contributes to this cause by having a opensource lincense. But then
then there is the choice of wich opensource license to choose.  I think it is important to choose a license that fits my needs.
I released a couple of things under the MIT license. But after a little more research into opensource licenses I concluded the GPV v3 license is more what I am looking for.
I din't write down my thoughts when choosing the MIT license. I learned from that by starting this tech-diary and writing down my thoughts one important lessons for later  But i think i choose it for its simplicity. It is short and to the point. The 2 key points are:

- I am not liable, wich means i cant be sued if someone uses my code and it blows up in there face
- Always provide this license when distributing the code

The 2 things that are missing (and wich GPL adds) to this and which I find rather imporpant are the following:

- any fork of my project should also be opensource (this is the important one)
- no sublicensing, this basicly says that anything based on my project must adhere to this license (this reinforces the previous point)

Plus a lot of the projects a rely on every day are released under gpl. Linux and git to name a few.
And I think the license these projects use is part of what made them so successful. Because everyone can look at the source and make there own contributions or forks. And because of the of the points mentioned above, its a gift that keeps on giving.
